Still in active development, this mod aims to be an alternative to the Steam Leaderboards for custom charts played using [TrombLoader](https://github.com/tc-mods/TrombLoader).

### Instructions

1. Install the mod through Thunderstore/r2modman
2. Open the game!
3. Sign up for an account in-game!
4. Play any chart that you want, and be THE Trombone Champ!

Charts being tracked can be searched in https://toottally.com/search/ or accessed programmatically in https://toottally.com/api/songs/
Charts can be manually uploaded in https://toottally.com/upload/

A guide for creating custom themes can be found [here](https://bit.ly/toottallythemeguide)
