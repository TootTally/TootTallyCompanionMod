# TootTally Companion Mod

> Version: 0.2.7

The companion mod for submitting scores to [TootTally](https://toottally.com/)

Still in active development, this mod aims to be an alternative to the Steam Leaderboards for custom charts played using [TrombLoader](https://github.com/NyxTheShield/TrombLoader/).

### Instructions

1. Install the mod through Thunderstore/r2modman
2. Go to [TootTally](https://toottally.com/) and sign up for an account.
3. After signup, you will be given an API Key. Copy-paste this API Key to TootTally's config.
4. Open the game, and enjoy! You will now be able to submit scores, and view other people's scores!

Charts being tracked can be searched in https://toottally.com/search/ or accessed programmatically in https://toottally.com/api/songs/
Charts can be manually uploaded in https://toottally.com/upload/
